# Credit Card Fraud Detection Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for a machine learning classification task on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objective is to build a robust classifier capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises numerical features extracted from clients' credit card transactions. Each transaction is labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. Notably, the dataset presents a significant imbalance between the two classes, posing a challenge that requires careful consideration during model development.

## Task Description

### 1. Data Exploration

- **Understanding the Structure**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure and identify any necessary data preparation steps.

### 2. Data Preparation and Model Training

- **Classifier Selection**: Choose an appropriate classification algorithm for the task.

- **Model Training**: Train the selected classifier using the dataset.

- **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**: Apply techniques such as undersampling or oversampling to address the class imbalance and enhance model performance.

### 3. Deployment Strategy

- **Real-time Querying**: Design a deployment strategy with the aim of querying the trained model in real-time (see below for the suggested deployment strategy).

## Repository Contents

- **Codebase**: Contains the implementation of the classification task.

- **README.md**: This documentation providing an introduction, task description, and instructions.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/dariobrunelli/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
  ```
2. Download the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/) dataset and store it in the folder where the file *fraud_detection.ipynb* is.  
3. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. Execute the code in *fraud_detection.ipynb* to perform data exploration, model training, and any other necessary tasks.  

> [!NOTE]
> I run the code with *Google Colab* from a *Google Drive* folder, as it was faster in training the models than my local CPU

# Model Deployment Strategy for Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Goal
The primary objective of the deployment strategy is to integrate the trained Credit Card Fraud Detection model, selected among the ones inspected, into a real-time system, allowing for on-the-fly predictions.

## Steps

1. **Model Serialization:**
   - Serialize the trained model into a deployable format (e.g., pickle, joblib) for ease of deployment.

2. **Containerization:**
   - Utilize containerization tools like Docker to encapsulate the model and its dependencies into a standalone container. This ensures consistency and portability across different environments.

3. **Model API:**
   - Develop a RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) to expose the model's prediction functionality. Tools like Flask or FastAPI can be employed for this purpose.

4. **Cloud Deployment:**
   - Deploy the containerized model on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance.

5. **Load Balancing:**
   - Implement load balancing mechanisms to distribute incoming prediction requests evenly across multiple instances of the deployed model. This ensures optimal performance during varying levels of traffic.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up monitoring tools to track model performance, response times, and resource utilization. Implement logging to record important events and errors for later analysis.

7. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement security measures to safeguard the deployed model and API. This includes authentication mechanisms, encryption, and access controls.

8. **Scaling and Autoscaling:**
   - Design the deployment to scale horizontally by adding more instances based on demand. Implement autoscaling policies to automatically adjust the number of instances to handle varying workloads.

9. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Establish a CI/CD pipeline to facilitate automated testing, model updates, and seamless deployment. This ensures a smooth workflow from development to production.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Provide comprehensive documentation for developers and stakeholders, detailing how to interact with the API, expected inputs, and interpretation of outputs.

11. **Feedback Loop:**
    - Set up a feedback loop to continuously monitor model performance in the production environment. Use the insights gained to refine and improve the model over time.

12. **Versioning:**
    - Implement version control for the deployed model to support backward compatibility and easy rollback in case of issues with newer versions.

Adjustments may be necessary based on specific requirements and the chosen deployment environment.
